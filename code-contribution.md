# Code Base Contribution Guide

Have you ever wanted to contribute to an open source project and community? This guide will help you understand the overall organization of the Kubecost project, and direct you to the best places to get started contributing. Youâ€™ll be able to share ideas, pick up issues, write code to fix them, and get your work reviewed and merged.

Kubecost offers a number of open-source software projects and tools which allow for contribution from the community, such as:

* [Kubecost documentation](https://github.com/kubecost/docs)
* [Eventing API](https://github.com/kubecost/events)
* [Kubecost Helm chart](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart)
* [Lens Kubecost Extension](https://github.com/kubecost/kubecost-lens-extension)
* [kubectl-cost](https://github.com/kubecost/kubectl-cost)
* [Cluster Turndown](https://github.com/kubecost/cluster-turndown)

The core of Kubecost is based on the open source CNCF project [OpenCost](https://www.opencost.io/). Read OpenCost's [contribution guide](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.
