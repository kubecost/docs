# What is Kubecost Cloud?

Kubecost Cloud is a SaaS solution that offers easier deployment and more convenient maintenance as an alternative to our on-prem product. You can get started with a free trial [here](http://app.kubecost.com/signup).

## Functionality

## Is Kubecost Cloud right for me?

Kubecost Cloud can help teams oversee cloud spend like our existing product, but there are more reasons this hosted version can be advantageous:

* Simplicity: Kubecost will handle your upgrades, scaling, and maintenance.
* Cost effective: Kubecost Cloud will empower users to think big, start small, and scale quickly. Save on team time when you donâ€™t host on-prem.
* Security: We take responsibility for ensuring information on our servers is secure and private.

## Using existing Kubecost documentation

Kubecost Cloud brings lots of the same functionality from our existing on-prem product, but there are several distinct differences in their composition that may prevent you from consulting standard Kubecost documentation for assistance. We do not recommend you consult our other live documentation resources for help, and instead contact us directly at [cloud-support@kubecost.com](mailto:cloud-support@kubecost.com) with questions. Hyperlinks embedded in this group of docs may take you to live Kubecost web properties for additional information where relevant.

All information found in this group of docs will be applicable for your installation and experience. Over time, we hope to expand this group to assist with troubleshooting and support.
