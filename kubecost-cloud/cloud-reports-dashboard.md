# Cloud Reports Dashboard

{% hint style="info" %}
This documentation should only be consulted when using Kubecost Cloud! For information about the Reports dashboard, see [here](https://docs.kubecost.com/using-kubecost/navigating-the-kubecost-ui/saved-reports).
{% endhint %}

The Reports dashboard allows you to save defined Allocations and Assets queries for quick access. All saved reports will display their type (Allocation/Assets), window duration, and what they aggregate by.

## Creating a report

Start by selecting _Create a report_, then select which dashboard you want to query for. You can also go directly to either dashboard and set up your query. On either dashboard, once you have the parameters you want to save, select _Save Report_. You can choose a custom name for your report, but one will auto-generate based on your parameters, then select _Save_. The query will now show on the Reports dashboard.

## Deleting a report

Reports can be deleted directly from the Reports dashboard by selecting the three dots icon under Actions, then selecting _Delete_. You can also delete a report by selecting it, then selecting _Unsave Report_ on the corresponding dashboard. Confirm with _Unsave_.
