# Kubecost Cloud GCP Marketplace Licensing

Kubecost Cloud is [available for licensing on GCP Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/kubecost-public/kubecost-cloud) and can be installed in minutes. This guide will take you through licensing through GCP Marketplace, and next steps for setting up Kubecost Cloud. Kubecost currently offers 30 days of Kubecost Cloud free without licensing fees.

Licensing Kubecost Cloud through GCP Marketplace will not directly integrate your GCP billing data into your Kubecost Cloud environment. For more information, see our [GCP Cloud Integration guide](/kubecost-cloud/kubecost-cloud-cloud-billing-integrations/kubecost-cloud-gcp-integration.md).

Under "1. Select Plan", the default plan should be Cloud Pro, and the default usage fee should be USD 0.167 per node per day. You can use the Pricing Calculator in the right sidebar to determine estimated costs by providing estimated timeframe of usage from 1 day to 1 year, and total node count.

Under "2. Purchase Details", select the billing account you wish to associate Kubecost Cloud with from the dropdown.

Under "3. Terms", read and agree to the terms and conditions, which include Google Cloud Marketplace Terms of Service as well as the Kubecost Terms of Service. Then, select _Subscribe_. Wait a moment while your order request is processed. Select _Go to Product Page_ in the pop-up which should appear once the order has been sent to Kubecost. If you have not already, select _Sign up with provider_ on the product page and provide all necessary user info to get your Kubecost Cloud account set up. Purchase orders should be automatically processed. Refresh the product page until you see _Manage on Provider_. Selecting this will take you from GCP Marketplace to the Kubecost Cloud login page.
