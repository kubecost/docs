# Receiving Kubecost Cloud Support

Kubecost values your feedback when it comes to ensuring Kubecost Cloud meets your expectations and performs seamlessly. Below is our approach to support in order to ensure customer feedback is acknowledged and assisted with.

## Categorization of support requests

Issues, bugs, and other customer requests are classified into one of three categories based on level of severity:

### Tier 1

These are business critical issues, involving total failure or severe degradation of services. 

### Tier 2

These are degraded service incidents, involving partial failure of mild degradation of services.

### Tier 3

These are general issues, not considered business critical or partially degraded. This includes assistance with the product, implementation questions, and feature requests.

## Service level agreement model

See below how response time and additional support actions are handled based on each tier:

| **Tier** | **First Response time** | **Additional actions** |
