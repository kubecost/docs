# Kubecost Cloud: Assets Dashboard

{% hint style="info" %}
This documentation should only be consulted when using Kubecost Cloud! For information about the Assets dashboard for self-hosted Kubecost, see [here](/using-kubecost/navigating-the-kubecost-ui/assets.md).
{% endhint %}

The Kubecost Assets dashboard shows Kubernetes cluster costs broken down by the individual backing assets in your cluster (e.g. cost by node, disk, and other assets). Itâ€™s used to identify spend drivers over time and to audit Allocation data. This view can also optionally show out-of-cluster assets by service, tag/label, etc.

## UI overview <a href="#ui-overview" id="ui-overview"></a>

### Date range <a href="#date-range" id="date-range"></a>

You can control the window of allocation spend by selecting _Last 7 days_ (the default option), and choosing the time window you want to view spend for. When using custom dates instead of a preset, select _Apply_ to make changes.

### Aggregate By <a href="#aggregate-by" id="aggregate-by"></a>

Here you can aggregate cost by namespace, deployment, service, and other native Kubernetes concepts. While selecting _Single Aggregation_, you will only be able to categorize by one concept at a time. While selecting _Multi Aggregation_, you will be able to filter for multiple concepts at the same time.

### Edit Report <a href="#edit-report" id="edit-report"></a>

Selecting _Edit Report_ will provide filtering and visualization options.

**Resolution**

Choose one of the following ways to display your query data on the dashboard:

* Daily: Default, displays data as a bar graph with daily steps
* Entire window: Displays all cost data as a semicircle graph with proportionate costs of your aggregate

**Cost metric**

View either cumulative or run rate costs measured over the selected time window based on the resources allocated.

* Cumulative Cost: represents the actual/historical spend captured by the Kubecost agent over the selected time window
* Rate metrics: Monthly, daily, or hourly "run rate" cost, also used for projected cost figures, based on samples in the selected time window

**Filters**

Filter resources by namespace, cluster, and/or Kubernetes label to more closely investigate a rise in spend or key cost drivers at different aggregations such as deployments or pods. When a filter is applied, only resources with this matching value will be shown.Comma-separated lists are supported to filter by multiple values, e.g. label filter equals `kube-system,kubecost`. Wild card filters are also supported, indicated by a `*` following the filter, e.g. `label=kube*` to return any namespace beginning with `kube`.

### Additional options <a href="#additional-options" id="additional-options"></a>

The three horizontal dots icon provides additional means of handling your query data. You can open a saved report or download your query data as a CSV file.
