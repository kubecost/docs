# Using the Kubecost Cloud UI

Kubecost Cloud's UI shares many similarities in feature functionality with self-hosted Kubecost. However, while Kubecost Cloud is expanding in utility, there may be distinct differences that require users to consult specific product documentation depending on which version of Kubecost they are using. This docs group contains information on the multiple Kubecost Cloud pages and dashboards.
