## Node exporter

Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels, written in Go with pluggable metric collectors.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Node Exporter is disabled by default. You can enable it with the flags:

```
--set prometheus.server.nodeExporter.enabled=true
--set prometheus.serviceAccounts.nodeExporter.create=true
```

{% endhint %}

## Prometheus

Prometheus emits metrics which are used by Kubecost for diagnostic purposes: 

| Metric                          | Description              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |

## NVIDIA GPUs

NVIDIA GPU monitoring support can be explained in more detail in the [Kubecost Docs: NVIDIA GPU Monitoring Configurations](/install-and-configure/advanced-configuration/gpu.md) and on the [Kubecost Blog: Monitoring NVIDIA GPU Usage in Kubernetes with Prometheus](https://blog.kubecost.com/blog/nvidia-gpu-usage/). Monitoring of NVIDIA GPUs requires DCGM Exporter. While all metrics exposed by DCGM Exporter are collected, the following metrics are the ones currently used by Kubecost:

| Metric                          | Description              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `DCGM_FI_PROF_GR_ENGINE_ACTIVE` | GPU utilization          |
