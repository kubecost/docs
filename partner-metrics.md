## Standardizing Kubernetes cost allocation

Measuring costs in Kubernetes environments is complex. Applications and their resources are often ephemeral.
Teams and even departments share the same resources without transparent prices attached.
Organizations are oftentimes running resources on disparate machine types or even multiple cloud providers.
We created the Kubecost Partners project to help partners manage this complexity and provide cost visibility for their users.

To assist, we have created a common definition for determining the cost of pods, services, namespaces and more.
We provide partners a suite of APIs, documentation, and compliance tests designed to run in a range of Kubernetes environments, including all top cloud providers and on-premise.
We also provide a spec implementation in our open source repository to ensure consistency and accuracy across a broad range of projects.
