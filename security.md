Privacy and security are incredibly important to our team. We believe that users should own and fully control their data, especially when it comes to sensitive cost and product usage metrics.
For this reason, our product does not share any data out of your infrastructure to external Kubecost services and uses read-only Kubernetes privileges in our core product.
You can even disable all internet egress in our namespace/product if desired, more [here](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.5/getting-started/kubernetes/tutorials/advanced-policy#4-deny-all-egress-traffic).

For more information on Kubecost privacy and security, please reach out to us at <team@kubecost.com>.
