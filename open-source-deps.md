Open Source
===========

Kubecost has an open core business model. 

Our commercial project is based on our cost-model open source project, which has an Apache 2.0 license. 
Here is a list of the direct [open source dependencies](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-model/blob/master/go.mod#L9) that we also include as part of our project.
