Open-Source
===========

Kubecost has open source at the center of our business model. 

Our commercial project is built on top of the [OpenCost CNCF Sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/opencost/), which has an Apache 2.0 license. 
Here is a list of the direct [open-source dependencies](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/blob/develop/go.mod) that we also include as part of our project.
