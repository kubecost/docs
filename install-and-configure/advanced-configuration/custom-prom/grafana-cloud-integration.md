# Grafana Cloud Integration for Kubecost

[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) is a composable observability platform, integrating metrics, traces and logs with Grafana. Customers can leverage the best open source observability software without the overhead of installing, maintaining, and scaling your observability stack.

This document will show you how to integrate the Grafana Cloud Prometheus metrics service with Kubecost.

## Prerequisites

* You have access to a running Kubernetes cluster
* You have created a Grafana Cloud account
* You have permissions to create Grafana Cloud API keys

## Step 1: Install the Grafana Agent on your cluster

Install the Grafana Agent for Kubernetes on your cluster. On the existing K8s cluster that you intend to install Kubecost, run the following commands to install the Grafana Agent to scrape the metrics from Kubecost `/metrics` endpoint. The script below installs the Grafana Agent with the necessary scraping configuration for Kubecost, you may want to add additional scrape configuration for your setup. Please remember to replace the following values with your actual Grafana cloud's values:

* `REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-REMOTE-WRITE-ENDPOINT`
* `REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-REMOTE-WRITE-USERNAME`
* `REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-REMOTE-WRITE-API-KEY`
* `REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME`

```
{% endcode %}

You can also verify if `grafana-agent` is scraping data with the following command  (optional):

```
kubectl -n kubecost logs grafana-agent-0
```

To learn more about how to install and config Grafana agent as well as additional scrape configuration, please refer to [Grafana Agent](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/configuration/grafana-agent/) documentation or you can check Kubecost Prometheus scrape config at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/ebe7e088debecd23f90e6dd75b425828901a246c/cost-analyzer/charts/prometheus/values.yaml#L1152).

## Step 2: Create `dbsecret` to allow Kubecost to query the metrics from Grafana Cloud Prometheus:

Create two files in your working directory, called `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` respectively

```
export PASSWORD=<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-REMOTE-WRITE-API-KEY>
export USERNAME=<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-REMOTE-WRITE-USERNAME>
printf "${PASSWORD}" > PASSWORD
printf "${USERNAME}" > USERNAME
```

Verify that you can run queries against your Grafana Cloud Prometheus query endpoint (optional):

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
cred="$( echo $NAME:$PASSWORD | base64 )"; curl -H "Authorization: Basic $cred" https://<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-QUERY-ENDPOINT>/api/v1/query?query=up
```
{% endcode %}

Create K8s secret name `dbsecret`:

```
kubectl create secret generic dbsecret \
    --namespace kubecost \
    --from-file=USERNAME \
    --from-file=PASSWORD
```

Verify if the credentials appear correctly (optional):

```
kubectl -n kubecost get secret dbsecret -o json | jq '.data | map_values(@base64d)'
```

## Step 3 (optional): Configure Kubecost recording rules for Grafana Cloud using Cortextool

To set up recording rules in Grafana Cloud, download the [Cortextool CLI utility](https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools). While they are optional, they offer improved performance.

After installing the tool, create a file called _kubecost\_rules.yaml_ with the following command:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```yaml
cat << EOF > kubecost-rules.yaml
namespace: "kubecost"
groups:
  - name: CPU
    rules:
      - expr: sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container_name!=""}[5m]))
        record: cluster:cpu_usage:rate5m
      - expr: rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container_name!=""}[5m])
        record: cluster:cpu_usage_nosum:rate5m
      - expr: avg(irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container_name!="POD", container_name!=""}[5m])) by (container_name,pod_name,namespace)
        record: kubecost_container_cpu_usage_irate
      - expr: sum(container_memory_working_set_bytes{container_name!="POD",container_name!=""}) by (container_name,pod_name,namespace)
        record: kubecost_container_memory_working_set_bytes
      - expr: sum(container_memory_working_set_bytes{container_name!="POD",container_name!=""})
        record: kubecost_cluster_memory_working_set_bytes
  - name: Savings
    rules:
      - expr: sum(avg(kube_pod_owner{owner_kind!="DaemonSet"}) by (pod) * sum(container_cpu_allocation) by (pod))
        record: kubecost_savings_cpu_allocation
        labels:
          daemonset: "false"
      - expr: sum(avg(kube_pod_owner{owner_kind="DaemonSet"}) by (pod) * sum(container_cpu_allocation) by (pod)) / sum(kube_node_info)
        record: kubecost_savings_cpu_allocation
        labels:
          daemonset: "true"
      - expr: sum(avg(kube_pod_owner{owner_kind!="DaemonSet"}) by (pod) * sum(container_memory_allocation_bytes) by (pod))
        record: kubecost_savings_memory_allocation_bytes
        labels:
          daemonset: "false"
      - expr: sum(avg(kube_pod_owner{owner_kind="DaemonSet"}) by (pod) * sum(container_memory_allocation_bytes) by (pod)) / sum(kube_node_info)
        record: kubecost_savings_memory_allocation_bytes
        labels:
          daemonset: "true"
EOF
```
{% endcode %}

Then, make sure you are in the same directory as your `_kubecost\_rules.yaml_`, and load the rules using Cortextool. Replace the address with your Grafana Cloud’s Prometheus endpoint (Remember to omit the /api/prom path from the endpoint URL).

```
cortextool rules load \
--address=<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-ENDPOINT> \
--id=<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-REMOTE-WRITE-USERNAME> \
--key=<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-REMOTE-WRITE-API-KEY> \
kubecost_rules.yaml
```

Print out the rules to verify that they’ve been loaded correctly:

```
cortextool rules print \
--address=<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-ENDPOINT> \
--id=<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-REMOTE-WRITE-USERNAME> \
--key=<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-REMOTE-WRITE-API-KEY>
```

## Step 4: Install Kubecost on the cluster

Install Kubecost on your K8s cluster with Grafana Cloud Prometheus query endpoint and `dbsecret` you created in Step 2.

```
helm upgrade -i -n kubecost kubecost kubecost/cost-analyzer \
    --namespace kubecost \
    --set global.prometheus.fqdn=https://<REPLACE-WITH-GRAFANA-PROM-QUERY-ENDPOINT> \
    --set global.prometheus.enabled=false \
    --set global.prometheus.queryServiceBasicAuthSecretName=dbsecret
```

The process is complete. By now, you should have successfully completed the Kubecost integration with Grafana Cloud.

Optionally, you can also add our [Kubecost Dashboard for Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15714) to your organization to visualize your cloud costs in Grafana.
