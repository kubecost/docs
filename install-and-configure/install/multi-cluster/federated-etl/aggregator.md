# Kubecost Aggregator

Aggregator is the primary query backend for Kubecost. It is enabled in all
configurations of Kubecost. In a default installation, it runs within the
cost-analyzer pod, but in a multi-cluster installation of Kubecost, some settings
must be changed. Multi-cluster Kubecost uses the [Federated
ETL](federated-etl.md) configuration without Thanos (replacing the
[Federator](federated-etl.md#other-components) component).

{% hint style="info" %}
Existing documentation for Kubecost APIs will use endpoints for non-Aggregator environments unless otherwise specified, but will still be compatible after configuring Aggregator.
{% endhint %}

## Configuring Aggregator

### Prerequisites

* Multi-cluster Aggregator can only be configured in a federated ETL environment
* This documentation is for Kubecost v2.0 and higher.
* To upgrade from a Thanos multi-cluster environment to Aggregator, see our [transition doc](/install-and-configure/install/multi-cluster/federated-etl/thanos-migration-guide.md).

### Configuration

Select from one of the two templates below and save the content as _federated-store.yaml_. This will be your configuration template required to set up Aggregator.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The name of the .yaml file used to create the secret must be named _federated-store.yaml_ or Aggregator will not start.
{% endhint %}

#### Basic configuration

```yaml
kubecostAggregator:
  replicas: 1
  deployMethod: statefulset
  cloudCost:
    enabled: true
federatedETL:
  federatedCluster: true
kubecostModel:
  containerStatsEnabled: true
  cloudCost:
    enabled: false
  federatedStorageConfigSecret: federated-store
kubecostProductConfigs:
  clusterName: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME
  cloudIntegrationSecret: cloud-integration
  productKey:
    enabled: true
    key: YOUR_KEY
prometheus:
  server:
    global:
      external_labels:
        cluster_id: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME
# when using managed identity/irsa, set the service account accordingly:
serviceAccount:
  create: false
  name: kubecost-irsa-sa
```

#### Aggregator Optimizations

For larger deployments of Kubecost, Aggregator can be tuned.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Aggregator is a memory and disk-intensive process. Ensure that your cluster has enough resources to support the configuration below.

Because the Aggregator PV is relatively small, the least expensive performance gain will be to move the storage class to a faster SSD. The storageClass name varies by provider, the terms used are gp3/extreme/premium/etc.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
{% endhint %}

The settings below are in addition to the basic configuration above.

```yaml
kubecostAggregator:
  env:
    # Aggregator pulls data from federated store and promotes this write data on a schedule
    # this interval governs how often aggregator will refresh its data
    # if it is set below the time it takes to ingest data, it less efficient
    DB_BUCKET_REFRESH_INTERVAL: 1h
    # governs parallelism of derivation step
    # more threads speeds derivation, but requires significantly more
    # log level
    # default: info
    LOG_LEVEL: info
    # Increases window of data ingested from federated store.
    # default: 91
    ETL_DAILY_STORE_DURATION_DAYS: "91"
  aggregatorDbStorage:
    # governs storage size of aggregator DB storage
    # !!NOTE!! disk performance is _critically important_ to aggregator performance
    # ensure disk is specd high enough, and check for bottlenecks
    # default: 128Gi
    storageRequest: 512Gi
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 1Gi
    limits:
      # cpu: 2000m
      memory: 16Gi
```

There is no baseline for what is considered a larger deployment, which will be dependent on load times in your Kubecost environment.

Once youâ€™ve configured your _federated-store.yaml_, create a secret using the following command:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
kubectl create secret generic federated-storage -n kubecost --from-file=federated-store.yaml
```
{% endcode %}

Next, you will need to create an additional `cloud-integration` secret. Follow this tutorial on [creating cloud integration secrets](/install-and-configure/install/cloud-integration/multi-cloud.md#step-2-create-cloud-integration-secret) to generate your _cloud-integration.json_ file, then run the following command:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
kubectl create secret generic cloud-integration -n kubecost --from-file=cloud-integration.json
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, upgrade your existing Kubecost installation. This command will install Kubecost if it does not already exist:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Upgrading your existing Kubecost using your configured _federated-store_.yaml_ file above will reset all existing Helm values configured in your _values.yaml_. If you wish to preserve any of those changes, append your _values.yaml_ by adding the contents of your _federated-store.yaml_ file into it, then replacing `federated-store.yaml` with `values.yaml` in the upgrade command below:
{% endhint %}

```sh
helm upgrade --install "kubecost-primary" \
  --namespace kubecost-primary \
  --repo https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/ cost-analyzer \
  -f aggregator.yaml
```

### Validating Aggregator pod is running successfully

When first enabled, the aggregator pod will ingest the last 90 days (if
applicable) of ETL data from the federated-store. Because the combined folder is
ignored, the legacy Federator pod is not used here, but can still run if needed.
As `ETL_DAILY_STORE_DURATION_DAYS` increases, the amount of time it will take
for Aggregator to make data available will increase. You can run `kubectl get
pods` and ensure the `aggregator` pod is running, but should still wait for all
data to be ingested.
