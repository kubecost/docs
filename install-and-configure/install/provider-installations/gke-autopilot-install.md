# Installing Kubecost on GKE Autopilot Clusters

## Installing Kubecost for GKE Autopilot via Helm

Installing Kubecost on a GKE Autopilot cluster is similar to other cloud providers with Helm v3.1+, with a few changes. Autopilot requires the use of [Google Managed Prometheus](/install-and-configure/advanced-configuration/custom-prom/gcp-gmp-integration.md) service, which generates additional costs within your Google Cloud account.

`helm install kubecost/cost-analyzer -n kubecost -f values.yaml`

Your _values.yaml_ files must contain the below parameters. Resources are specified for each section of the Kubecost deployment, and Pod Security Policies are disabled.

```

  clusterName: "<clusterName>" # used for display in Kubecost UI

## Turning on Kubelet/cAdvisor scraping via Google Managed Collector

Open the OperatorConfig on your Autopilot Cluster resource for editing:

```
kubectl -n gmp-public edit operatorconfig config
```

Add the following collection section to the resource:

```
apiVersion: monitoring.googleapis.com/v1
kind: OperatorConfig
metadata:
  namespace: gmp-public
  name: config
collection:
  kubeletScraping:
    interval: 30s
```

Save the file and close the editor. After a short time, the Kubelet metric endpoints will be scraped and the metrics become available for querying in Managed Service for Prometheus.
