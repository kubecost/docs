# Cloud Billing Integrations

Integration with cloud service providers (CSPs) via their respective billing APIs allows Kubecost to display out-of-cluster (OOC) costs (e.g. AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage Account). Additionally, it allows Kubecost to reconcile Kubecost's in-cluster predictions with actual billing data to improve accuracy.

For more details on these integrations, continue reading below. For guides on how to set up these integrations, follow the relevant link:

* [Multi-Cloud](multi-cloud.md)
* [AWS](aws-cloud-integrations.md)
* [GCP](https://docs.kubecost.com/install-and-configure/install/cloud-integration/gcp-out-of-cluster)
* [Azure](https://docs.kubecost.com/install-and-configure/install/cloud-integration/azure-out-of-cluster)

> **Note**: Select _Amortized cost_ while setting up the cost-management-billing in Azure. GCP users should create [detailed billing export](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery-tables#detailed-usage-cost-data-schema) to gain access to all of Kubecost cloud integration features including [reconciliation](cloud-integration.md#reconciliation)

## Kubecost's cloud processes

As indicated above, setting up a cloud integration with your CSP allows Kubecost to pull in additional billing data. The two processes that incorporate this information are **Reconciliation** and **Cloud Usage**.

### Reconciliation

Reconciliation matches in-cluster assets with items found in the billing data pulled from the CSP. This allows Kubecost to display the most accurate depiction of your in-cluster spend. Additionally, the reconciliation process creates `Network` assets for in-cluster nodes based on the information in the billing data. The main drawback of this process is that the CSPs have between a 6 to 24 hour delay in releasing billing data, and reconciliation requires a complete day of cost data to reconcile with the in-cluster assets. This requires a 48 hour window between resource usage and reconciliation. If reconciliation is performed within this window, asset cost is deflated to the partially complete cost shown in the billing data.

Cost-based metrics are based on onDemand pricing unless there is definitive data from a cloud provider that the node is not onDemand. This way estimates are as accurate as possible. If a new reserved instance is provisioned or a node joins a savings plan:

1. Kubecost continues to emit onDemand pricing until the node is added to the cloud bill.
2. Once the node is added to the cloud bill, Kubecost starts emitting something closer to the actual price.
3. For the time period where Kubecost assumed the node was onDemand but it was actually reserved, reconciliation fixes the price in ETL.

> **Note:** The reconciled Assets will inherit the labels from the corresponding items in the billing data. If there exist identical label keys between the original assets and those of the billing data items, the label value of the original asset will take precedence.

### Cloud Usage

The Cloud Usage process allows Kubecost to pull in out-of-cluster cloud spend from your CSP's billing data. This includes any services run by the CSP in addition to compute resources outside of clusters (OOC) monitored by Kubecost. Additionally, by labeling these Cloud Usage, their cost can be distributed to Allocations as external costs. This can help teams get a better understanding of the proportion of OOC cloud spend that their in-cluster usage is dependant on. CloudUsages become available as soon as they appear in the billing data, with the 6 to 24 hour delay mentioned above, and are updated as they become more complete.

## Cloud integration configurations

The Kubecost Helm chart provides values that can enable or disable each cloud process on the deployment once a cloud integration has been set up. Turning off either of these processes will disable all the benefits provided by them.

|  `.Values.kubecostModel.cloudAssetsExcludeProviderID` |  false  | **This is a BETA feature, support may be dropped in future releases.** Enabling this flag pre-aggregates CloudUsage at the service and user label level. This gives higher performance build speeds and improved asset query times at the aggregated level. This feature is meant for users with extrememly large CURs only. For insights below the aggregated level, Athena can queried dirrectly by clicking on the aggregated line item. This query has filters for Provider, Account, Service and Label of the line item being examined. This highly filtered query will take longer to load, around 20-30 seconds. Drilling down below the aggregate level uses ad-hoc queries to Athena which have a fixed cost that is partially based on the size of the dataset being queried. Since this feature is meant for users with larger CURs this cost can accumulate. To get a better idea of your per query check the Athena rate for your region [here](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/), and view the ammount of data being scanned per query in the Athena dashboard. This Helm value corresponds to the `CLOUD_ASSETS_EXCLUDE_PROVIDER_ID` environment variable. Currently only available on AWS. |
|          `.Values.kubecostModel.etlUseUnblendedClost` |  false  | **This is a BETA feature, support may be dropped in future releases.** Enabling this flag makes Cloud Usage and Reconciliation use unblended cost for all line items in the CUR including those with savings plans and RI's applied to them. This will cause the amortized upfront costs of these resources to not appear in Kubecost and may cause some assets to have a $0 value if their cost was entirely upfont. This Helm value corresponds to the `ETL_USE_UNBLENDED_COST` environment variable. Currently only available on AWS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Cloud Stores

The ETL contains a Map of Cloud Stores, each of which represents an integration with a CSP. Each Cloud Store is responsible for the Cloud Usage and Reconciliation Pipelines which add OOC costs and adjust Kubecost's estimated cost respectively via cost and usage data pulled from the CSP. Each Cloud Store has a unique identifier called the `ProviderKey` which varies depending on which CSP is being connected to and ensures that duplicate configurations are not introduced into the ETL. The value of the `ProviderKey` is the following for each CSP at a scope that the billing data is being for:

* AWS: Account Id
* GCP: Project Id
* Azure: Subscription Id

The `ProviderKey` can be used as an argument for the endpoints for Cloud Usage and Reconciliation, to indicate that the specified operation should only be done on a single Cloud Store rather than all of them, which is the default behavior. Additionally, the Cloud Store keeps track of the Status of the Cloud Connection Diagnostics for each of the Cloud Usage and Reconciliation. The Cloud Connection Status is meant to be used as a tool in determining the health of the Cloud Connection that is the basis of each Cloud Store. The Cloud Connection Status has various failure states that are meant to provide actionable information on how to get your Cloud Connection running properly. These are the Cloud Connection Statuses:

* _INITIAL\_STATUS_: The zero value of Cloud Connection Status and means that cloud connection is untested. Once Cloud Connection Status has been changed and it should not return to this value. This status is assigned on creation to the Cloud Store
* _MISSING\_CONFIGURATION_: Kubecost has not detected any method of Cloud Configuration. This value is only possible on the first Cloud Store that is created as a wrapper for the open source cloud provider. This status is assigned during failures in Configuration Retrieval.
* _INCOMPLETE\_CONFIGURATION_: Cloud Configuration is missing required values to connect to the cloud provider. This status is assigned during failures in Configuration Retrieval.
* _FAILED\_CONNECTION_: All required Cloud Configuration values are filled in, but a connection with the Cloud Provider cannot be established. This is indicative of a typo in one of the Cloud Configuration values or an issue in how the connection was set up in the CSP's Console. The assignment of this status varies between Providers but should happen if there if an error is thrown when an interaction with an object from from the Cloud Service Provider's SDK occurs.
* _MISSING\_DATA_: The Cloud Integration is properly configured, but the cloud provider is not returning billing/cost and usage data. This status is indicative of the billing/cost and usage data export of the Cloud Provider being incorrectly set up or the export being set up in the last 48 hours and not having started populating data yet. This status is set when a query has been successfully made but the results come back empty. If the cloud provider, already has a SUCCESSFUL\_CONNECTION status then this status should not be set, because this indicates that the specific query made may have been empty.
* _SUCCESSFUL\_CONNECTION_: The Cloud Integration is properly configured and returning data. This status is set on any successful query where data is returned

After starting or restarting Cloud Usage or Reconciliation two subprocesses are started, one which fills in historic data over the coverage of the Daily CloudUsage and Asset Store respectively and one which runs periodically, on a predefined interval, to collect and process new cost and usage data as it is made available by the Cloud Service Provider. The ETL's status endpoint contains a `cloud` object that provides information about each Cloud Store including the Cloud Connection Status and diagnostic information about Cloud Usage and Reconciliation. The diagnostic items on the Cloud Usage and Reconciliation are:

* Coverage: The window of time that historical subprocess has covered
* LastRun: The last time that the process ran, updates each time the periodic subprocess runs
* NextRun: Next scheduled run of the periodic subprocess
* Progress: Ratio of Coverage to Total amount of time to be covered
* RefreshRate: The interval that the periodic subprocess runs
* Resolution: The window size of the process
* StartTime: When the Cloud Process was started

## EndPoints

### Cloud Usage

#### Rebuild

`http://<kubecost-address>/model/etl/cloudUsage/rebuild`

Description:

Completely restart Cloud Usage Pipeline. This operation ends the currently running Cloud Usage Pipeline and rebuilds historic CloudUsages in the Daily CloudUsage Store.

Example uses:

* `http://localhost:9090/model/etl/cloudUsage/rebuild`

* `http://localhost:9090/model/etl/cloudUsage/rebuild?commit=true`
* `http://localhost:9090/model/etl/cloudUsage/rebuild?commit=true&provider=######-######-######`

API parameters include the following:

* `commit` is a boolean flag that acts as a safety precaution, these can be long-running processes so this endpoint should not be run arbitrarily. a `true` value restarts the process.
* `provider` is an optional parameter that takes the Provider Key described above. If included only the specified Cloud Store will run the operation, if it is not included all Cloud Stores in the ETL will run the operation.

#### Repair
