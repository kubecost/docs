# 1-click Request Sizing

> **Note**: This feature is in a pre-release (alpha/beta) state. It has limitations. Please read the documentation carefully.

1-click request sizing is a feature that will instantly update [container resource requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits) in your cluster based on Kubecost's sizing [recommendations](api-request-right-sizing.md).

If you want to learn more about the APIs that power 1-click request sizing, including their limitations, see the corresponding [API documentation](api-request-recommendation-apply.md).
