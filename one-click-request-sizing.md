=============================

> **Note**: This feature is in a pre-release (alpha/beta) state. It has limitations. Please read the documentation carefully.

1-click request sizing is a feature that will instantly update [container
resource
requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits)
in your cluster based on Kubecost's sizing
[recommendations](https://github.com/kubecost/docs/blob/main/api-request-right-sizing.md).

If you want to learn more about the APIs that power 1-click request sizing,
including their limitations, see the corresponding [API
documentation](https://github.com/kubecost/docs/blob/main/api-request-recommendation-apply.md).
