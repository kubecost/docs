# Add Key

You can apply your product key at any time within the product UI or during an install or upgrade process. More details on both options are provided below.

`kubecostToken` is a different concept from your product key and is used for managing trial access.

## At install-time

Many Kubecost product configuration options can be specified at install-time, including your product key.

### Option 1: Storing productkey in a secret

To create a secret you will need to create a JSON file called _productkey.json_ with the following format. Be sure to replace `<YOUR_PRODUCT_KEY>` with your Kubecost product key.

```javascript
{ 
    "key": "<YOUR_PRODUCT_KEY>"
}
```

Run the following command to create the secret. Replace `<SECRET_NAME>` with a name for the secret (example: `productkeysecret`):

```shell
$ kubectl create secret generic <SECRET_NAME> -n kubecost --from-file=./productkey.json
```

Update your [_values.yaml_](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/5eedab0433445a5b8e134113beb95f4598cd5e2d/cost-analyzer/values.yaml#L714-L717) to enable the product key and specify the secret name:

* `kubecostProductConfigs.productKey.enabled = true`
* `kubecostProductConfigs.productKey.secretname = <SECRET_NAME>`

Run a `helm upgrade` to start using your product key.

### Option 2: Specifying product key in _values.yaml_

This specific parameter can be configured under `kubecostProductConfigs.productKey.key` in your [_values.yaml_](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/84dfbe4addedfee55b50af6ca44c1f62966d4457/cost-analyzer/values.yaml#L426).

> **Note**: you must also set the `kubecostProductConfigs.productKey.enabled` config to `true` when using this option. That this will leave your secrets unencrypted in _values.yaml_. Use a Kubernetes secret as in the previous method to avoid this.

## In product

To apply your license key within the Kubecost UI, visit the Overview page and then select *Upgrade* in the page header.

Next, select *Add Key* in the dialog menu shown below.

You can then supply your Kubecost provided license key in the input box that is now visible.
