# Container Request Right-Sizing Recommendation API (V1)

{% hint style="danger" %}
This API is now deprecated. This page should not be consulted. Please reference [Container Request Right-Sizing Recommendation API (v2)](/apis/savings-apis/api-request-right-sizing-v2.md) for updated information.

The container request right-sizing recommendation API provides recommendations for [container resource requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) based on configurable parameters and estimates the savings from implementing those recommendations on a per-container, per-controller level. Of course, if the cluster-level resources stay static then you will likely not enjoy real savings from applying these recommendations until you reduce your cluster resources. Instead, your idle allocation will increase.

| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `targetCPUUtilization`  | float in the range (0,1] | An amount of headroom to enforce with the new request, based on the calculated (real) usage. If the calculated usage is, for example, 100 mCPU and this parameter is `0.8`, the recommended CPU request will be `100 / 0.8 = 125` mCPU. Inputs that fail to parse (see https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#ParseFloat) or are greater than 1 will not error; they will instead default to your savings profile's default value. If you have not changed the profile, this is `0.65`. |
| `targetRAMUtilization`  | float in the range (0,1] | Calculated like CPU.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Savings Projection Methodology

The request right-sizing recommendation includes an estimate of the savings that can be realized by applying the request right-sizing recommendations. To calculate this estimation, we use each container's lifetime and the overall data window (max observed cluster lifetime within `window`). We assume each container will run on the same node (and therefore have the same resource costs) it ran on historically; calculate the monthly rate for that container with the new, reduced resource requests; and then we scale that monthly rate by `container lifetime in window/data window`. This will underestimate savings for recently-created controllers (e.g. a Deployment created 3 days ago in a 7-day data window will be assumed to run for 3/7 of the next month when calculating monthly savings), but avoids some edge cases that vastly overestimate savings.

### Savings projection examples

#### Two Pods, each with their own controller

We have a 1 hour window with 2 pods that _look_ like they each have their own controller. Each pod has 1 container (with the same name).

All CPU costs are $7/core-hour

Pod 1 ran for 15 minutes \[t=15min, t=30min], allocated 3 cores, and used an avg and max of 1 core.

Pod 2 ran for 20 minutes \[t=45min, t=60min], allocated 3 cores, and used an avg and max of 2 cores.

```
|   ---      | Pod 1 exists
|         ---| Pod 2 exists
|____________|
  time ->
|            |
0 min        60min
```

Window = \[0min, 60min]

We'll right-size with a target utilization of 100%:

* Pod 1 will be right-sized to an allocation of 1 core.
* Pod 2 will be right-sized to an allocation of 2 cores.

What should the estimated monthly savings of this right-sizing be?

Controller 1 = Pod 1 ran for (15/45) of the known duration of the cluster being alive (we don't know if it was alive from \[t=0, t=15]). That's (45 min / (60 min/hr) / (730 hr/month)) of a month.

Within the query window, the pod could have saved: 2 cores \* (15min / (60 min/hr)) = 0.5 core-hours 0.5 core-hours \* $7/core-hour = $3.50

"If that 45 minute window is representative for 30 days (730 hrs) then we scale the savings by 1 / (45 / 60 / 730)": $3.50 \* 1 / (45 / 60 / 730) = $3406.67

For Pod 2 = Controller 2 we can take the same numbers from Pod 1 = Controller 1 and halve the savings because it has half the CPU core savings.

Savings: $3406.67/mo / 2 = $1703.34/mo

Total savings = $3406.67/mo + $1703.34/mo = $5110.01/mo

#### The above, but the Pods share a controller

We resize the shared container to 2 cores, reducing the savings of pod 1 to be the same as the savings for pod 2, because both pods had the same overall allocation.

Controller 1 = Pod 1 and Pod 2 ran for 45/45 minutes of the known duration of the cluster being alive (we don't know if it was alive from \[t=0, t=15]). That's (45 min / (60 min/hr) / (730 hr/month)) of a month.

Within the query window, Pod 1 could have saved: 1 cores \* (15min / (60 min/hr)) = 0.25 core-hours 0.25 core-hours \* $7/core-hour = $1.75

Pod 2 saves the same amount = $1.75

That's a total savings for the controller of: $1.75 \* 2 = $3.50

"If that 45 minute window is representative for 30 days (730 hrs) then we scale the savings by 1 / (45 / 60 / 730)": Total savings = $3.50 \* 1 / (45 / 60 / 730) = $3406.67/mo
