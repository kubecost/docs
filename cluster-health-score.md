Cluster Health Score 
====================

The health score starts at 100. Penalties reduce the score. There are three penalty types:

    SevereErrorPenalty = 50
    ErrorPenalty       = 15
    WarningPenalty     = 3

WarningPenalty is applied when:
 
 - Single Cluster (Master exists on Cluster - for kops based kubernetes deployments on AWS)
 - Single Region
 - Predictive Disk Growth crosses a 90% threshold
 
 
ErrorPenalty is applied:

 - Any Nodes in the Cluster are Not Ready
 - Any Nodes are under MemoryPressure
 
SevereErrorPenalty is applied:
 
 - Memory Usage exceeds 90% of Available Memory on the Cluster

### Alert

The [Cluster Health](/alerts.md#type-cluster-health) alert is based on a threshold of change. For example an alert on 14 would alert anytime an Error penalty was applied.
