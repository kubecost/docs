User Management - SSO/SAML
==========================

Kubecost’s SSO/SAML 2.0 support makes it easy to manage application access and works with top identity providers, incuding Okta, Auth0, AzureAD, PingID, and KeyCloak. Below are the high-level access control options that Kubecost supports:

* **User authentication** provides a simple mechanism to restrict application access internally and externally  
* **Custom access roles** restrict a user's access to a limited set of namespaces, labels, cluster, or other aggregations
* **Pre-defined user roles** can be managed to provide tiered access  
    * Admin: has permissions to manage users, configure model inputs, and application settings.  
    * Viewer: user role with read-only permission
