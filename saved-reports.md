# Saved Reports Documentation

### Summary

Kubecost supports configuring saved report parameters through [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/master/cost-analyzer/values.yaml), allowing users to configure multiple saved custom reports on start up in addition to configuration through the UI. This reference outlines the process of configuring saved reports through a values file and provides documentation on the required and optional parameters.
  
### Saved Report Parameters  
  
The saved report settings, under `global.savedReports`, accept two parameters:

* `enabled` determines whether Kubecost will read saved reports configured via `values.yaml`; default `false`   
* `reports` is a list of report parameter maps
    
The following fields apply to each map item under the `reports` key:

* `title` the title/name of your custom report; any non-empty string is accepted
* `window` the time window the allocation report covers, the following values are supported:
	* key words: `today`, `week` (week-to-date), `month` (month-to-date), `yesterday`, `lastweek`, `lastmonth`
	* number of days: `{N}d` (last **N** days)
		* e.g. `30d` for the last 30 days
	* date range: `{start},{end}` (comma-separated **RFC-3339 date strings** or **unix timestamps**)
		* e.g. `2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-01-02T00:00:00Z` for the single day of 1 January 2021
		* e.g. `1609459200,1609545600` for the single day of 1 January 2021
	* _Note: for all window options, if a window is requested that spans "partial" days, the window will be rounded up to include the nearest full date(s)._
		* e.g. `2021-01-01T15:04:05Z,2021-01-02T20:21:22Z` will return the two full days of 1 January 2021 and 2 January 2021
* `aggregateBy` the desired aggregation parameter -- equivalent to *Breakdown* in the Kubecost UI. Supports:
  * `cluster`
  * `container`
  * `controller`
  * `controllerKind`
  * `daemonset`
  * `department`
  * `deployment`
  * `environment`
  * `job`
  * `label` requires the following format: `label:<label_name>`
  * `namespace`
  * `node`
  * `owner`
  * `pod`
  * `product`
  * `service`
  * `statefulset`
  * `team`
* `idle` idle cost allocation, supports `hide`, `shareByNode`, `shareByCluster`, and `separate`
* `accumulate` determines whether or not to sum Allocation costs across the entire window -- equivalent to *Resolution* in the UI, supports `true` (Entire window resolution) and `false` (Daily resolution)
* `filters` -- a list of maps consisting of a property and value
	* `property` -- supports `cluster`, `node`, `namespace`, and `label`
	* `value` -- property value(s) to filter on, supports wildcard filtering with a `*` suffix
		* Special case `label` `value` examples: `app:cost-analyzer`, `app:cost*`
			* Wildcard filters only apply for the label value. e.g., `ap*:cost-analyzer` is not valid
	* *Note: multiple filter properties evaluate as ANDs, multiple filter values evaluate as ORs*
		* *e.g., (namespace=foo,bar), (node=fizz) evaluates as (namespace == foo || namespace == bar) && node=fizz*
	* **Important:** If no filters used, supply an empty list `[]`

### Example Helm values.yaml Saved Reports Section

*Note: `values.yaml` will overwrite any previously saved reports. Any reports saved afterward through the UI will also be overwritten on restart.*

```
   # Set saved report(s) accessible in reports.html
   # View configured saved reports in <front-end-url>/model/reports
  savedReports:
    enabled: true # If true, overwrites report parameters set through UI
    reports:
      - title: "Example Saved Report 0"
        window: "today"
        aggregateBy: "namespace"
        idle: "separate"
        accumulate: false # daily resolution
        filters:
          - property: "cluster"
            value: "cluster-one,cluster*" # supports wildcard filtering and multiple comma separated values
          - property: "namespace"
            value: "kubecost"
      - title: "Example Saved Report 1"
        window: "month"
        aggregateBy: "controllerKind"
        idle: "shareByNode"
        accumulate: false
        filters:
          - property: "label"
            value: "app:cost*,environment:kube*"
          - property: "namespace"
            value: "kubecost"
      - title: "Example Saved Report 2"
        window: "2020-11-11T00:00:00Z,2020-12-09T23:59:59Z"
        aggregateBy: "service"
        idle: "hide"
        accumulate: true # entire window resolution
        filters: [] # if no filters, specify empty array

```

### Troubleshooting

Review these steps to verify that saved reports are being passed to the Kubecost application correctly:

1. Confirm that `global.savedReports.enabled` is set to `true`

2. Ensure that the Helm values are successfully read into the configmap

-   Run `helm template ./cost-analyzer -n kubecost > test-saved-reports-config.yaml`
-   Open `test-saved-reports-config`
-   Find the section starting with `# Source: cost-analyzer/templates/cost-analyzer-saved-reports-configmap.yaml`
-   Ensure that the Helm values are successfully read into the configmap under the `data` field. Example below.

```
# Source: cost-analyzer/templates/cost-analyzer-saved-reports-configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: saved-report-configs
  labels:
    
    app.kubernetes.io/name: cost-analyzer
    helm.sh/chart: cost-analyzer-1.70.0
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: RELEASE-NAME
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
    app: cost-analyzer
data:
  saved-reports.json: '[{"accumulate":false,"aggregateBy":"namespace","filters":[{"property":"cluster","value":"cluster-one,cluster*"},{"property":"namespace","value":"kubecost"}],"idle":"separate","title":"Example Saved Report 0","window":"today"},{"accumulate":false,"aggregateBy":"controllerKind","filters":[{"property":"label","value":"app:cost*,environment:kube*"},{"property":"namespace","value":"kubecost"}],"idle":"shareByNode","title":"Example Saved Report 1","window":"month"},{"accumulate":true,"aggregateBy":"service","filters":[],"idle":"hide","title":"Example Saved Report 2","window":"2020-11-11T00:00:00Z,2020-12-09T23:59:59Z"}]'# Source: cost-analyzer/templates/cost-analyzer-alerts-configmap.yaml
```

3. Ensure that the json string is successfully mapped to the appropriate configs

-   Navigate to `<front-end-url>/model/reports` and ensure that the configured report parameters have been set by selecting the "Open saved reports" button in the upper right hand corner of the report card.
