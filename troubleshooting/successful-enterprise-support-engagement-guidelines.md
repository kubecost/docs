# Guidelines for a Successful Enterprise Support Engagement

## Availability
Please make sure that you are available to work with Kubecost support at the scheduled times agreed upon. There are instances when the Kubecost Support team or Success team will bring in additional resources.

## One Issue per Support Case
In order to provide efficiency, the Kubecost team requests that customers focus on a single issue per support case. If you are experiencing multiple issues, we request that you open up a new case so that we can assign the right resources for each issue to each individual case.

## Diagnostic Information
If the Kubecost team requests information, please ensure that you provide all information that is requested. This often means bug reports, logs, HAR files, heap dumps and bug reports from multiple Kubecost instances in every environment. If how to provide the data is unclear, let us know and we will assist. There may be instances where support will request a [copy of the Database](https://github.com/kubecost/kubecost-utilities/tree/main/aggregator-backup#reliable-usage) from the Aggregator pod. Having the requested information in its entirety provides an optimal support experience.

## Older Versions of Kubecost

Kubecost delivers rapidly developing features and customers benefit from running the latest version to take advantage of all new features, bug fixes and security enhancements. 

## Collaborative Support
Kubecost uses Google Meet or Zoom as a collaborative support tool. These tools allow us to accelerate support by directly engaging, reviewing and observing behavior on a users system. If these collaborative support tools cannot be used in your environment, we are happy to use a collaborative tool used within your organization.

We have an extensive internal network of Engineers that collaborate with our Support Services to resolve customer cases. We frequently request additional Engineers to work on the support cases to ensure that the right resources provide input in order to speed resolution. If there are no active tasks to accomplish during a collaborative support session, we may disengage in order to continue investigation internally.
In order to respect everyoneâ€™s time on a collaborative screen share session, please ensure that everyone is prepared to work through the specific tasks. In general, it is favorable to use collaborative support to observe an issue and directly troubleshoot.

Kubecost respects security protocols and measures that are in place. If sharing data or engaging in a screen share is NOT possible, turnaround times could be impacted. We will adjust accordingly to help achieve the desired outcome as rapidly and efficiently as possible.
