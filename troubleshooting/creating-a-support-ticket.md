# Creating a Kubecost Support Ticket in Slack

The Kubecost support team offers several channels for creating support tickets. This document will show how to create a new support ticket using Slack, which can be used in the public #support channel, or a private channel created for your orginization.

1. Create a new Slack message thread in the Slack channel.

2. Add the `:ticket:` emoji to your new Slack thread. The Thena bot will then reply in your Slack thread to assist you in the process.

5. A new support ticket (Zendesk) will be created. For your reference, the Ticket ID will be visible. From this point on, all discussion in the Slack thread will be automatically synchronized with our ticketing system. This ticket will be assigned to one of our support engineers who will assist you shortly.
