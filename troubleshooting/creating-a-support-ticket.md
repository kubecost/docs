# Creating a Kubecost Support Ticket in Slack

The Kubecost support team offers several channels for creating support tickets. This document will show how to create a new support ticket using Slack, which can be used in the public #support channel, or a private channel created for your organization. Kubecost's Slack is publicly available and can be joined by following [this link](https://kubecost.com/join-slack).

1. Create a new Slack message thread in the Slack channel.

5. A new support ticket will be created in Zendesk. For your reference, the Ticket ID will be visible. From this point on, all discussion in the Slack thread will be automatically synchronized with our ticketing system. This ticket will be assigned to one of our support engineers who will assist you shortly.
