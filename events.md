Events API
=============

Kubecost emits events when certain things happen. Those events are also recorded in an event log in the interest of diagnosing problems.

## Event kinds

* `AllocationSetSavedEvent` describes a saved AllocationSet
  * size: number of records in the set
  * window: window of the set
* `AllocationSetLoadedEvent` describes a loaded AllocationSet
  * size: number of records in the set
  * window: window of the set
* `AllocationSetAggregatedEvent` describes aggregating an AllocationSet
  * size: number of records in the set
  * window: window of the set
* `AllocationSetTotaledEvent` describes totaling an AllocationSet
  * window: window of the set
* `AllocationSetReconciledEvent` describes reconciling an AllocationSet
  * window: window of the set
* `AllocationSetComputeErrorEvent` describes an error in computation
* `AllocationSetReconcileErrorEvent` describes an error in reconciliation
* `AssetSetSavedEvent` described a saved AssetSet
  * size: number of records in the set
  * window: window of the set
* `AssetSetLoadedEvent` described a loaded AssetSet
  * size: number of records in the set
  * window: window of the set
* `AssetSetAggregatedEvent` described aggregating an AssetSet
  * size: number of records in the set
  * window: window of the set
* `AssetSetTotaledEvent` described totaling an AssetSet
  * window: window of the set
* `AssetSetReconciledEvent` described reconciling an AssetSet
  * window: window of the set
* `AssetSetComputeErrorEvent` described an error in computation
* `AssetSetReconcileErrorEvent` described an error in reconciliation

## Event log

To access the most recent events in the event log, invoke `GET <kubecost>/model/etl/log`, which will provide the following, e.g.:
