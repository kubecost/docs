# Unclaimed Volumes
Kubecost will display volumes unused by any pod. You can consider these volumes for deletion, or move them to a cheaper storage tier.

You can access the Unclaimed Volumes page by selecting *Savings* in the left navigation, then selecting *Manage unclaimed volumes*.

Volumes will be displayed in a table, and can be sorted _By Owner_ or _By Namespace_. You can view owner, storage class, and size for your volumes.

Using the Cluster dropdown, you can filter volumes connected to an individual cluster in your environment.
