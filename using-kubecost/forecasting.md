# Forecasting

Forecasting is a predictive cost monitoring tool which can visualize cost forecasts across Kubecost's major monitoring pages; [Allocations](cost-allocation/README.md), [Assets](assets.md), and [Cloud Cost Explorer](cloud-costs-explorer.md).

Forecasting can be accessed from any of these dashboards by selecting *Edit* > *Chart* > *Cost Forecast*. You can then choose your desired window of projected spend from the date range picker. Projected spend is visualized with a margin of error. Hovering over the projected spend will provide you the projected cost and confidence interval.
