# Spot Commander

Spot Commander is a Savings feature which identifies workloads where it is available and cost-effective to switch to Spot nodes, resizing the cluster in the process. Spot-readiness is determined through a [checklist](spot-checklist.md) which analyzes the workload and assesses the minimal cost required. It also generates CLI commands to help you implement the recommendation.

## Spot Cluster Sizing Recommendation

The recommended Spot cluster configuration uses all of the data available to Kubecost to compute a "resizing" of your cluster's nodes into a set of on-demand (standard) nodes `O` and a set of spot (preemptible) nodes `S`. This configuration is produced from applying a scheduling heuristic to the usage data for all of your workloads. This recommendation offers a more accurate picture of the savings possible from implementing spot nodes because nodes are what the cost of a cluster is made up of; once `O` and `S` have been determined, the savings are the current cost of your nodes minus the estimated cost of `O` and `S`.

### Implementing the recommended configuration

The recommended configuration assumes that all workloads considered spot-ready by the [Spot Checklist](spot-checklist.md) will be schedulable on spot nodes and that workloads considered not spot-ready will only be schedulable on on-demand nodes. Kubernetes has [taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) for achieving this behavior. Cloud providers usually have guides for using spot nodes with taints and tolerations in your managed cluster:

* [AWS (EKS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html#managed-node-group-capacity-types)&#x20;
* [GCP (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/preemptible-vms)
* [Azure (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/spot-node-pool)&#x20;

Different cloud providers have different guarantees on shutdown windows and automatic draining of spot nodes that are about to be removed. Consult your providerâ€™s documentation before introducing spot nodes to your cluster.

Kubecost marking a workload as spot ready is not a guarantee. A domain expert should always carefully consider the workload before approving it to run on spot nodes.

### How the recommended cluster configuration is determined

Determining `O` and `S` is achieved by first partitioning all workloads on the cluster (based on the results of the Checklist) into sets: spot-ready workloads `R` and non-spot-ready workloads `N`. Kubecost consults its maximum resource usage data (in each Allocation, Kubecost records the MAXIMUM CPU and RAM used in the window) and determines the following for each of `R` and `N`:

* The maximum CPU used by any workload
* The maximum RAM used by any workload
* The total CPU (sum of all individual maximums) required by non-DaemonSet workloads
* The total RAM (sum of all individual maximums) required by non-DaemonSet workloads
* The total CPU (sum of all individual maximums) required by DaemonSet workloads
* The total RAM (sum of all individual maximums) required by DaemonSet workloads

Kubecost uses this data with a configurable target utilization (e.g., 90%) for `R` and `N` to create `O` and `S`:

* Every node in `O` and `S` must reserve `100% - target utilization` (e.g., `100% - 90% = 10%`) of its CPU and RAM
* Every node in `O` must be able to schedule the DaemonSet requirements in `R` and `N`
* Every node in `S` must be able to schedule the DaemonSet requirements in `R`
* With the remaining resources:
* The largest CPU requirement in `N` must be schedulable on a node in `O`
* The largest RAM requirement in `N` must be schedulable on a node in `O`
* The largest CPU requirement in `R` must be schedulable on a node in `S`
* The largest RAM requirement in `R` must be schedulable on a node in `S`
* The total CPU requirements of `N` must be satisfiable by the total CPU available in `O`
* The total RAM requirements of `N` must be satisfiable by the total RAM available in `O`
* The total CPU requirements of `R` must be satisfiable by the total CPU available in `S`
* The total RAM requirements of `R` must be satisfiable by the total RAM available in `S`

### Usage tips

It is recommended to set the target utilization at or below 95% to allow resources for the operating system and the kubelet.

The configuration currently only recommends one node type for `O` and one node type for `S` but we are considering adding multiple node type support. If your cluster requires specific node types for certain workloads, consider using Kubecost's recommendation as a launching point for a cluster configuration that supports your specific needs.
