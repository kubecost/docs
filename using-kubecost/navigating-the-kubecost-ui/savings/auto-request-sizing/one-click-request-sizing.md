# 1-click Request Right-Sizing

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is in beta. Please read the documentation carefully.
{% endhint %}

1-click request right-sizing (RRS) is a feature that will instantly update [container resource requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits) in your cluster based on Kubecost's sizing [recommendations](../../../../api-request-right-sizing-v2.md).

If you want to learn more about the APIs that power 1-click RRS, including their limitations, see the corresponding [API documentation](../../../../api-request-recommendation-apply.md).

## Setup

See the high-level [container request right-sizing guide](https://docs.kubecost.com/using-kubecost/navigating-the-kubecost-ui/savings/auto-request-sizing).

## Using 1-click RRS

1.  Select _Savings_ in the left navigation, then select _Right-size your container requests_. The Request right-sizing recommendations page opens.
