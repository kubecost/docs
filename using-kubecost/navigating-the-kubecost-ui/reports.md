# Reports

Reports are saved queries from your various Monitoring dashboards which can be referenced at a later date for convenience. Aggregation, filters, and other details of your query will be saved in the report, and the report can be opened at any time. Reports are currently supported by the Allocations, Assets, and Cloud Cost Explorer dashboards.

Reports can be managed via [_values.yaml_](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/master/cost-analyzer/values.yaml) or the Kubecost UI. This reference outlines the process of configuring saved reports through a values file, and provides documentation on the required and optional parameters.

## Managing reports via UI

### Creating a report

Begin by selecting _Create a report_. There are five report types available. Three of these correspond to Kubecost's different monitoring dashboards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of Kubecost v2, Advanced Reports and Cloud Cost Reports have been removed and replaced with [Collections](/using-kubecost/navigating-the-kubecost-ui/collections.md). See the documentation for more info.
{% endhint %}

* Allocation Report
* Asset Report
* Cloud Cost Report

Selecting a monitoring report type will take you to the respective dashboard. Provide the details of the query, then select _Save_. The report will now be saved on your Reports page for easy access.

### Sharing reports

After creating a report, you are able to share that report in recurring intervals via email as a PDF or CSV file. Shared reports replicate your saved query parameters every interval so you can view cost changes over time.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sharing reports is only available for Allocations, Assets, and Cloud Cost Reports, not either type of Advanced Report.
{% endhint %}

In the line for the report you want to share, select the three horizontal dots icon in the Actions column. Select _Share report_ from the menu. The Share Report window opens. Provide the following fields:

* Interval: Interval that recurring reports will be sent out. Supports _Daily_, _Weekly_, and _Monthly_. Weekly reports default to going out Sunday at midnight. Monthly reports default to midnight on the first of the month. When selecting _Monthly_ and resetting on a day of the month not found in every month, the report will reset at the latest available day of that month. For example, if you choose to reset on the 31st, it will reset on the 30th for months with only 30 days.
* Format: Supports _PDF_ or _CSV_.
* Add email: Email(s) to distribute the report to. If a custom SMTP configuration has been created, all outbound report emails will be sent through it.

Select _Apply_ to finalize. When you have created a schedule for your report, the selected interval will be displayed in the Interval column of your Reports page.

## Managing Allocation reports via _values.yaml_

The Allocation reports are saved under `global.savedReports`, accept two parameters:

* `enabled` determines whether Kubecost will read saved reports configured via _values.yaml_; default value is `false`
* `reports` is a list of allocation reports

The following fields apply to each map item under the `reports` key:

* `title` the title/name of your custom report; any non-empty string is accepted
* `window` the time window the allocation report covers, the following values are supported:
  * keywords: `today`, `week` (week-to-date), `month` (month-to-date), `yesterday`, `lastweek`, `lastmonth`
  * number of days: `{N}d` (last N days)
    * e.g. `30d` for the last 30 days
  * date range: `{start},{end}` (comma-separated RFC-3339 date strings or Unix timestamps)
    * e.g. `2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-01-02T00:00:00Z` for the single day of 1 January 2021
    * e.g. `1609459200,1609545600` for the single day of 1 January 2021
  * _Note: for all window options, if a window is requested that spans "partial" days, the window will be rounded up to include the nearest full date(s)._
    * e.g. `2021-01-01T15:04:05Z,2021-01-02T20:21:22Z` will return the two full days of 1 January 2021 and 2 January 2021

* `rate` -- Can be one of `cumulative`, `monthly`, `daily`, `hourly`
* `accumulate` determines whether or not to sum Allocation costs across the entire window -- equivalent to _Resolution_ in the UI, supports `true` (Entire window resolution) and `false` (Daily resolution)
* `sharedNamespaces` -- a list containing namespaces to share costs for.
* `sharedOverhead` -- an integer representing overhead costs to share.
* `sharedLabels` -- a list of labels to share costs for, requires the following format: `label:<label_name>`
* `filters` -- a list of maps consisting of a key, operator and value
  * `key` -- supports `cluster`, `node`, `namespace`, and others. Refer to the [v2 Filters Documentation](/apis/filters-api.md) for the complete list of supported keys.
  * `operator` -- supports operator such as `:`,`!:`,`~:`,`!~:` and others. Refer to the [v2 Filters Documentation](/apis/filters-api.md) for the complete list of operators.
  * `value` -- property value(s) to filter on. Some examples shown below.

## Managing Asset reports via _values.yaml_
The Asset reports are saved under `global.assetReports`, it accept two parameters:

    * e.g. `1609459200,1609545600` for the single day of 1 January 2021
  * _Note: for all window options, if a window is requested that spans "partial" days, the window will be rounded up to include the nearest full date(s)._
    * e.g. `2021-01-01T15:04:05Z,2021-01-02T20:21:22Z` will return the two full days of 1 January 2021 and 2 January 2021

## Managing Cloud Cost reports via _values.yaml_
The Cloud cost reports are saved under `global.cloudCostReports`, it accept two parameters:

* `costMetric` depicts the cloud cost metrics for the reports and takes value `listCost`, `netCost`, `amortizedNetCost`,`invoicedCost`, `amortizedCost`. This is equal to the cost metric size selection in Cloud Cost Kubecost UI.

## Combining UI report management with _values.yaml_

When defining reports via _values.yaml_, by setting `global.savedReports.enabled = true` in the values file, the reports defined in _values.yaml_ are created when the Kubecost pod starts. Reports can still be freely created/deleted via the UI while the pod is running. However, when the pod restarts, whatever is defined the values file supersedes any UI changes.

Generally, the ConfigMap, if present, serves as the source of truth at startup.

If saved reports are _not_ provided via _values.yaml_, meaning `global.savedReports.enabled = false`, reports created via the UI are saved to a persistent volume and persist across pod restarts.

## Troubleshooting

### Saved reports are not being passed to Kubecost correctly

Review these steps to verify that saved reports are being passed to the Kubecost application correctly:

1. Confirm that `global.savedReports.enabled` is set to `true`
2. Ensure that the Helm values are successfully read into the ConfigMap
   * Run `helm template ./cost-analyzer -n kubecost > test-saved-reports-config.yaml`
   * Open `test-saved-reports-config`
   * Find the section starting with `# Source: cost-analyzer/templates/cost-analyzer-saved-reports-configmap.yaml`
   * Ensure that the Helm values are successfully read into the ConfigMap under the `data` field. Example below.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
````
```
# Source: cost-analyzer/templates/cost-analyzer-saved-reports-configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: saved-report-configs
  labels:

    app.kubernetes.io/name: cost-analyzer
    helm.sh/chart: cost-analyzer-1.70.0
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: RELEASE-NAME
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
    app: cost-analyzer
data:
  saved-reports.json: '[{"accumulate":false,"aggregateBy":"namespace","filters":[{"property":"cluster","value":"cluster-one,cluster*"},{"property":"namespace","value":"kubecost"}],"idle":"separate","title":"Example Saved Report 0","window":"today"},{"accumulate":false,"aggregateBy":"controllerKind","filters":[{"property":"label","value":"app:cost*,environment:kube*"},{"property":"namespace","value":"kubecost"}],"idle":"shareByNode","title":"Example Saved Report 1","window":"month"},{"accumulate":true,"aggregateBy":"service","filters":[],"idle":"hide","title":"Example Saved Report 2","window":"2020-11-11T00:00:00Z,2020-12-09T23:59:59Z"}]'# Source: cost-analyzer/templates/cost-analyzer-alerts-configmap.yaml
```
````
{% endcode %}

3\. Ensure that the JSON string is successfully mapped to the appropriate configs

Navigate to your Reports page in the Kubecost UI and ensure that the configured report parameters have been set by selecting the Report name.

### Saved reports not appearing in Kubecost UI after upgrading to v2

After upgrading Kubecost to v2, saved reports may not properly display in the Kubecost UI. See the scripts available to migrate various settings in the [kubecost-utilities repo ](https://github.com/kubecost/kubecost-utilities/tree/main/settings-migration).
