# External Costs

{% hint style="info" %}
External Costs is currently in beta.
{% endhint %}

External Costs is a monitoring dashboard for third party service costs that are not directly from cloud providers. Currently, this includes monitoring for Datadog costs. More third party services are expected to be supported in the future.

## Enabling External Costs

Kubecost will require the integration of a service's plugin in order to detect and display costs associated with that service.

From your Datadog account, you will need the following values:

* `datadog_site`: ex. us5.datadoghq.com
* `datadog_api_key`: ex. c508d4fd3d126abbbbdc2fe96b0f6613
* `datadog_app_key`: ex. f357b1f4efefb0870109e0d1aa0cb437b5f10ab9

See Datadog's [API and Application Keys](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/) for help finding your API and application key values.

Now append your *values.yaml* file with the following, replacing the example Datadog values with your own. It is also crucial the following Helm flags are set to `true`:

* `kubecostModel.plugins.enabled`
* `kubecostModel.plugins.install.enabled`

```
plugins:
    enabled: true
    install:
      enabled: true
      fullImageName: curlimages/curl:latest
      securityContext:
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
        capabilities:
          drop:
          - ALL
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
    folder: /opt/opencost/plugin
    # leave this commented to always download most recent version of plugins
    # version: <INSERT_SPECIFIC_PLUGINS_VERSION>
    configs:
      # datadog: |
      #   {
      #   "datadog_site": "datadog_site",
      #   "datadog_api_key": "c508d4fd3d126abbbbdc2fe96b0f6613",
      #   "datadog_app_key": "f357b1f4efefb0870109e0d1aa0cb437b5f10ab9"
      #   }

```

Now update your Kubecost install via `helm`:

```
$ helm install kubecost cost-analyzer \
    --repo https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/ \
    --namespace kubecost --create-namespace \
    --values values.yaml
```
You should now have access to External Costs with visible cost metrics. You can also confirm by viewing pod logs to show Datadog queries going through.

## Configuring your query

### Date range

Select the date range of the report by setting specific start and end dates, or using one of the preset options.

### Aggregation

Here you can aggregate your results by one or several categories. While selecting Single Aggregation, you will only be able to select one concept at a time. While selecting Multi Aggregation, you will be able to filter for multiple concepts at the same time. Costs will be aggregated by *Domain* by default. Fields by which you can aggregate are:

* Zone
* Resource Type
* Account Name
* Provider ID
* Charge Category
* Usage Unit
* Resource Name
* Domain

### Filtering

Kubecost supports filtering of the above aggregation categories. When a filter is applied, only resources with this matching value will be shown. Supports advanced filtering options as well.

You can also view the External Costs page from the Cloud Cost Explorer, when aggregating by *Provider*. Third party services will appear on this page, and when any line item is selected, you will be taken to External Costs.
